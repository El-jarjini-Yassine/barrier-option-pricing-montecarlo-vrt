Barrier Option Pricing & Delta Hedging
Monte Carlo Simulation with Variance Reduction Techniques (VBA)**
This project implements the pricing and hedging of a Knock-Out Barrier Option using Monte Carlo simulation enhanced with several Variance Reduction Techniques (VRT).
Developed in VBA, presented as part of my Master in Applied Mathematics & Financial Engineering (MAIF).
Project Overview
Barrier options are path-dependent derivatives whose payoff depends on whether the underlying asset crosses a predefined barrier level.
This project focuses on:
Pricing an Up-and-Out / Down-and-Out European Option
Using Monte Carlo simulation under a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model
Applying Variance Reduction Techniques (VRT) to improve convergence
Studying Delta-Hedging strategies and the impact of the barrier
Producing a full quantitative report (LaTeX)
